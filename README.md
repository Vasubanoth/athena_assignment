Step-by-step explanation for every conversion

JSON-based numeral system definitions

Olympiad-style Practice Zone including:

Pattern Identification

Construction Challenges

Rule Inference puzzles

Auto-checker to validate user answers

JSON export of generated puzzles

Single unified convert(value, system) function

**How to Use**

Open global_numeral_app.ipynb in Google Colab.

Run all cells in sequence.

Converters, practice puzzles, and JSON export will generate automatically.

Modify or extend systems by editing the JSON generator blocks.
