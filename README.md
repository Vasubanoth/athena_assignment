Athena FT Assignment – Global Numeral Systems Learning App

This project implements an interactive learning tool that explores how different cultures represent numbers through Roman, Mayan, and Chinese numeral systems.
It was developed as part of the IIT BHU Athena FT Assessment (AI/ML Track).

Features : 
1.Roman, Mayan (base-20), and Chinese numeral converters
2.Step-by-step explanation for every conversion
3.JSON-based numeral system definition
4.Olympiad-style Practice Zone including:
5.Pattern Identification
6.Construction Challenges
7.Rule Inference puzzles
8.Auto-checker to validate user answers
9.JSON export of generated puzzles
10.Single unified convert(value, system) function

How to Use :
1.Open global_numeral_app.ipynb in Google Colab.
2.Run all cells in sequence.
3.Converters, practice puzzles, and JSON export will generate automatically.
4.Modify or extend systems by editing the JSON generator blocks.
